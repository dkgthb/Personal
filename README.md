# Personal

This is my personal recording stuffs, but is not as sensitive as to give up the convenience of using git nor to pay github to make this repository private.
This mostly consists of 
- To do list
- Deadlines
- What I learned today
- etc.

I believe there is noting much interesting stuffs in here, but feel free to look around if you do not think you do not have anything to do with your time currently.
