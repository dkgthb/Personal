# Personal

The contents in here are purely my personal stuffs, though they are not as sensitive as to give up the convenience of using git nor to pay github to make this repository private.
This repo mostly consists of 
- To do list
- Deadlines
- What I learned today
- etc.

I believe there are not much interesting stuffs in here, but feel free to look around if you are currently too bored and cannot find anything potentially interesting than this.
